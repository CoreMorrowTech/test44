# Electron App Build Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DLL Loading Issue
**Problem**: The `3App.dll` file was not found when the app was packaged, causing the error:
```
Êú™ÊâæÂà∞DLLÊñá‰ª∂ÔºåÊ£ÄÊü•ÁöÑË∑ØÂæÑ: ['D:\\Program Files (x86)\\electron-app\\resources\\app.asar\\3App.dll']
```

**Root Cause**: The DLL was being searched inside the `app.asar` archive, but native DLL files cannot be loaded from inside asar archives.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `getDllPath()` function in `core-koffi.js` to check multiple paths including the correct packaged app location
- Modified `package.json` build configuration to use explicit `extraFiles` mapping
- The DLL is now correctly placed in the app root directory (`dist/win-unpacked/3App.dll`) and found by the path resolution logic

### 2. Configuration Files Loading Issue
**Problem**: The frontend JavaScript was trying to load `device.json` and `config.json` using `fetch()`, which doesn't work in packaged Electron apps:
```
GET file:///E:/test44/dist/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar/device.json net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
```

**Solution**:
- Modified `loadDeviceConfigs()` function in `js/device-control.js` to use Node.js `fs` module instead of `fetch()`
- Added proper path resolution logic similar to the DLL loading
- Configuration files are now loaded correctly from the app root directory

### 3. Missing Search Icon
**Problem**: The `search.png` file was referenced in CSS but didn't exist, causing:
```
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND search.png
```

**Solution**:
- Replaced the missing image with a CSS-based search icon using Unicode emoji (üîç)
- Updated the `.search-btn` CSS class to use `::before` pseudo-element

## Key Changes Made

### core-koffi.js
- Enhanced `getDllPath()` and `getConfigPath()` functions with proper error handling
- Added support for both development and packaged app environments
- Improved path resolution logic to check multiple possible locations

### js/device-control.js
- Replaced `fetch()` calls with Node.js `fs.readFileSync()`
- Added path resolution logic for configuration files
- Improved error handling and logging

### package.json
- Updated `extraFiles` configuration to use explicit object format
- Ensured DLL and configuration files are properly copied to app root

### index.html
- Replaced missing `search.png` with CSS-based icon
- Improved search button styling

## Build Process
The app now builds successfully with:
```bash
npm run build:win
```

All native dependencies (DLL) and configuration files are properly resolved in both development and packaged environments.
